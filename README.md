# robo-car

In this project we make use of the Bluetooth technology to control our machine car. This machine can be controlled by any human using his android mobile phone, by downloading an app and connecting it with the Bluetooth module present inside our car. User can perform actions like moving forward, backward, moving left and right by the means of command using his-her mobile phone app.
